# Create PRD Command

Use the template at `tasks/create-prd.md` to create a Product Requirements Document.

## Instructions

1. Read `tasks/create-prd.md` for the PRD creation process
2. Ask the user to describe the feature they want to build
3. Follow the template: ask clarifying questions, then generate the PRD
4. Save the output to `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`

## Important

- Do NOT implement anything - PRD creation only
- Ask 3-5 clarifying questions before generating
- Write for junior developers - be explicit and specific
